"""Where everything lives, in one place.

Every script under ``tools/`` resolves its inputs through this module. The layout is
described once instead of five times, and a fresh clone can run any of the scripts
without first copying files around by hand -- which is what used to be required, since
the texture painter wants the manifest in ``tools/`` while the mesh verifier wanted it
next to the OBJ.

Nothing here imports anything from the mod. It is pure path arithmetic.
