"""Generates the detonation tinnitus ring.

Outputs
-------
src/main/resources/assets/descrycraft/sounds/tinnitus.ogg   mono, 44.1 kHz, ~1.9 s

Why this asset exists at all
----------------------------
Vanilla has nothing that reads as tinnitus. Bells and note blocks are clean
musical tones -- fast decay, tidy harmonics, they go *ding*. Cave ambience is
low and hollow, which is space, not ringing. What an ear does after a blast is
narrow-band, dry, high, and slightly unstable, so the ring is synthesised here
rather than borrowed.

The shape it is going for:

* **3.8 kHz.** Right in the band human hearing is most sensitive to, which is
  exactly why it is the one that lingers. An octave partial at 12% gives it a
  little metal instead of leaving it a pure test tone.
* **A slow fall in pitch.** A real ring is not a fixed note; it sags as it dies.
  150 Hz over the length of the clip is enough to hear without reading as a
  slide.
* **Exponential decay, tau 0.45 s.** Long enough to outlast the explosion, short
  enough that it is gone before the snow screen is.
* **A 5.5 Hz tremolo at 6%.** Barely there. Without it the tail sounds like a
  synthesiser holding a note; with it, like something in a head.

Requires ``numpy`` and ``soundfile``: ``pip install numpy soundfile``. Every
other script under ``tools/`` is stdlib only, but Python ships no Vorbis
encoder and Minecraft only reads Ogg Vorbis.
