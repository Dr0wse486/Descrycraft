"""Generates the drone's motor loop and its attack-run boom.

src/main/resources/assets/descrycraft/sounds/drone_boom.ogg    mono, 44.1 kHz, 0.60 s

Why these are synthesised rather than borrowed
----------------------------------------------
Vanilla has no small-electric-motor loop. The nearest candidates all carry the
wrong character: ``BEE_LOOP`` is an insect buzz with a wobble that reads as
organic, ``ELYTRA_FLYING`` is wind with no machinery in it, and
``MINECART_INSIDE`` is a rolling clatter on rails. For the attack run the mod
used to play ``FIREWORK_ROCKET_LAUNCH``, which is a rocket: a rising hiss with a
launch report, where a charge is a short supersonic crack.

How the motor spectrum was arrived at
-------------------------------------
The first attempt here was hand-tuned and wrong in a way that is easy to miss
without measuring: it built a low harmonic stack around 116 Hz, which is what a
large slow rotor sounds like, and put almost no energy above 1 kHz. A real
small quadcopter is the opposite - a bright, tearing hiss centred around 3 kHz
with a tonal core down at a couple of hundred hertz.

So the spectrum is not guessed. It is measured off a reference FPV recording
(the first two seconds, which is steady flight), high-passed at 80 Hz to drop
the wind and handling rumble that the microphone picked up but the aircraft did
not make. Then:

1. The reference's magnitude spectrum is smoothed into an envelope.
2. A candidate is built from that envelope - see below - and its energy in eight
   octave bands is compared with the reference's.
3. Each band is corrected by ``sqrt(target / actual)`` (energy goes as amplitude
   squared), the correction is interpolated across frequency so the envelope
   stays smooth, and the loop repeats.

Forty iterations of that put every band inside 0.5% of the target and the
spectral centroid at 2946 Hz against the reference's 3085 Hz. The resulting
96-point envelope is baked into ``SPECTRUM`` below, so this script needs no
audio file to run and the numbers it produces are auditable against the comment.

Only the *envelope* was taken. No samples from the reference are copied - which
matters, because it is a licensed stock effect and this repository is public.

Two ways to build the motor
---------------------------
``drone_motor.ogg`` can be produced either from the synthesis described below,
or directly from a reference recording passed on the command line::

    python tools/generate_drone_sounds.py --reference <fpv-recording.mp3>

The second mode is what the shipped asset actually uses. It sounds better - a
real recording carries the rotor beating, the prop wash and the small
irregularities that a two-layer synthesis cannot invent - and it is what the
project owner asked for. The catch is that the reference is a licensed stock
effect, so it is **not** in this repository and the shipped asset cannot be
regenerated from a fresh clone without it. That is a deliberate, known
limitation rather than an oversight. The synthesised path needs nothing but
``numpy`` and remains the fallback when no reference is given.

Two things have to be done to a recording before it can be looped:

* **Flatten the level.** The reference's own loudness drifts by nearly 9 dB over
  the two seconds - it starts quiet and swells. Loop that as-is and you get a
  half-hertz throb, which is far more noticeable than any seam. A slow RMS
  envelope is measured and divided out, so the loop sits at one level.
* **Crossfade at the START, not at the end.** The usual advice is to blend the
  tail into the head, and it is wrong: the head then gets played twice, which is
  a stutter. The correct place is the beginning of the loop, blended with the
  material that *follows* the loop's end. Written out, with a loop of ``n``
  samples and a crossfade of ``x``::

      out[i]     = body[i]                                  for i >= x
      out[0:x]   = body[n:n+x] * (1 - ramp) + body[0:x] * ramp

  At ``j = 0`` the loop therefore begins on ``body[n]``, which is exactly what
  followed ``body[n-1]`` in the original - so the seam is continuous in the
  original timeline, and the crossfade happens in the middle of the loop where
  a listener has nothing to compare it against.

How the candidate is built
--------------------------
Two layers, both periodic by construction (see "The loop seam" below):

* **Noise** - sinusoids on the integer-hertz grid with random phases and
  amplitudes from the envelope. This is the broadband hiss, and it carries most
  of the energy.
* **Comb** - harmonics of the rotor frequency, amplitudes also read off the
  envelope, so the tonal peaks sit exactly where the reference's do. Two banks,
  four hertz apart, because a real four-rotor machine never has its rotors in
  agreement and that beat is most of what makes it sound mechanical.

``COMB_LEVEL`` sets how much of the comb is mixed in, and was fitted the same
way as the envelope.

The loop seam
-------------
``drone_motor.ogg`` is meant to be played looping for as long as a drone is in
the air, so the seam has to be inaudible, and that constrains *every* layer.

The tone is easy: the clip is exactly one second long, so any partial whose
frequency is a whole number of hertz completes a whole number of cycles inside
it and lines up end to end. A detune of 0.7 Hz - what a real machine sounds like,
the rotors never quite agree - would leave the waveform 0.7 of a cycle out at the
seam and click once a second. Both rotor banks here are therefore whole hertz.

The noise layer is the harder half, and the obvious fix does not work. Blending
the tail into the head - the usual crossfade loop - makes the seam *continuous*
but not *correct*: the head ends up played twice, which is a stutter rather than
a click. Synthesising the noise on the integer-hertz grid instead makes it
periodic by definition, so the seam is indistinguishable from any other sample.

Reproducibility
---------------
The synthesis is deterministic - every random source is a seeded
``default_rng`` - so re-running this script always produces the same audio.
The *file bytes* are another matter: an Ogg page header carries a bitstream
serial number that the encoder picks at random, so two runs give two different
md5s for identical sound. Do not use ``md5sum`` as the regression check here;
decode and compare the PCM instead. (``generate_textures.py`` can be checked by
hash because PNG has no such field.)

Requires ``numpy`` and ``soundfile``: ``pip install numpy soundfile``. Every
other script under ``tools/`` is stdlib only, but Python ships no Vorbis
encoder and Minecraft only reads Ogg Vorbis.
