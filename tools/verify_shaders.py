"""Checks the post-processing chains against the programs they name.

This exists because of a bug that cost three features without leaving a trace. `PostChain` throws
`ChainedJsonException` when a pass declares a uniform the program does not have - and that exception
is an `IOException`, so `DroneSignal`'s catch swallowed it, latched the chain as broken and said
nothing. The symptom was that the signal blur and the detonation radial blur were simply absent,
with a clean log. A one line check would have caught it on the day it was written.

What is checked, per chain:

* every pass resolves to a program file that exists, and its vertex and fragment shaders exist;
* every uniform a pass declares is declared by that program - **this is the one that bit us**;
* every uniform a program declares is actually mentioned in one of its shader sources, since a
  declared-but-unused uniform is silently dropped by the driver and then reports a warning on load;
* every `intarget` / `outtarget` is either `minecraft:main` or one of the chain's own targets;
* the chain ends by writing back to `minecraft:main`, because `PostChain` has no notion of a final
  target - whatever the last pass wrote to is what the screen shows, and every vanilla chain ends
  with a `blit` back to main for exactly this reason.

Uniform *names* are compared, not types: a mismatch in `count` is a real error too, but the ones
that actually happen here are names.
