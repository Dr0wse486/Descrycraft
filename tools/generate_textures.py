holds the UV rectangle of every face, so the texture is packed by exactly the

    Every face still gets its own UV rectangle, but at this face count nothing may be painted
    *inside* one. The hard-surface model has 6675 body faces, and the rectangles that hold them
    are tiny - 86% are smaller than 5x5 pixels, and the commonest sizes are 4x3, 2x1 and 1x1. Two
    earlier passes both broke on that:

    * A one pixel inset border per rectangle was meant to meet along physical edges and read as a
      panel line. On a 2x2 rectangle the border is three quarters of the face, so instead of panel
      lines the hull became a grid of dark boxes.
    * Per pixel value jitter meant to read as hand made pixel art was keyed on absolute sheet
      coordinates, so all 6675 faces got a different random shade and every mirrored pair differed.
      That is the other half of why the underside looked asymmetric: the geometry mirrors, the
      noise did not.

    Both are gone. The sheet is flat colour per material, and the model's own 6893 facets supply
    every edge and highlight - which is the right division of labour for a hard surface mesh that
    already has more geometry than the old procedural one had by a factor of twenty six.

    Flat rectangles cannot bleed into their neighbours, because both render types this sheet feeds
    sample with blur and mipmaps off: {@code RenderType#entityCutout} and {@code RenderType#eyes}
    are each built on {@code TextureStateShard(texture, false, false)}.
